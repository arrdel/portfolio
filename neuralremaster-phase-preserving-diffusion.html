                    <h2>Introduction: The Spatial Structure Problem in Diffusion Models</h2>
                    <p>Diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI by enabling high-quality synthesis across
                        diverse domains—from photorealistic image generation to complex video understanding.
                        However, despite their remarkable capabilities, conventional diffusion models exhibit a
                        fundamental limitation when tasked with structure-aligned generation: they lack the ability
                        to preserve spatial information from input data during the generation process. This
                        shortcoming severely constrains their applicability to tasks requiring geometric
                        consistency, such as re-rendering scenes from novel viewpoints, enhancing simulated data to
                        match real-world distributions, and performing image-to-image translations where spatial
                        structure should remain stable.</p>
                    <p>The root cause of this limitation lies in the mathematical foundation of standard diffusion
                        processes. During the forward diffusion process, data is progressively corrupted through the
                        addition of Gaussian noise with randomly initialized Fourier coefficients—both magnitude and
                        phase components are randomized independently. While this approach has proven effective for
                        unconditional generation and text-to-image synthesis where structural flexibility is
                        desirable, it proves catastrophic for tasks where the spatial geometry of the input must be
                        preserved. Corrupting the phase information destroys the fine spatial structure and
                        geometric relationships encoded in the input, making it impossible for the model to maintain
                        consistency during the reverse generation process.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/neural_fig/fig2.png" alt="Refinement before and after">
                        <figcaption>Figure 2: Image generated with the same noise and different cutoff radius r. Results
                            are based on SD1.5.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>To address this critical gap, Zeng et al. introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion (φ-PD), a
                        model-agnostic reformulation of the standard diffusion process that fundamentally redefines
                        how noise is introduced to data. Rather than randomizing both magnitude and phase, φ-PD
                        preserves the input's phase information while selectively randomizing only the magnitude
                        components. This elegant architectural innovation requires no modifications to underlying
                        network architectures, introduces no additional learnable parameters, and adds zero
                        computational overhead during inference. The result is a simple yet powerful framework that
                        enables spatially aligned generation across diverse applications, from photorealistic
                        re-rendering to robotic simulation enhancement.</p>

                    <h2>Background: Fourier Analysis and the Structure of Diffusion</h2>
                    <p>To understand the innovation of phase-preserving diffusion, we must first examine how
                        information is encoded in the frequency domain. Any image or spatial signal can be
                        decomposed using the Fourier transform into two complementary components: magnitude and
                        phase. The magnitude spectrum captures information about the energy distribution across
                        different frequencies, while the phase spectrum encodes the precise spatial relationships
                        and structural details of the signal. This distinction is crucial—it has been
                        well-established in signal processing literature that phase information carries the majority
                        of perceptually relevant structural information in images.</p>
                    <p>Standard diffusion models operate in the spatial domain, progressively corrupting images by
                        adding Gaussian noise according to the forward diffusion equation:</p>
                    <p>$$q(x_t | x_0) = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon$$</p>
                    <p>where $\bar{\alpha}_t$ represents the cumulative product of alphas at timestep $t$, and
                        $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I})$ is standard Gaussian noise. When this Gaussian
                        noise is added to an image in the spatial domain, the corresponding operation in the
                        frequency domain involves randomizing both the magnitude and phase components of the noise
                        in Fourier space. This means that the phase structure of the original image—which encodes
                        its geometric properties and spatial arrangements—becomes progressively obscured and
                        eventually lost as $t$ increases.</p>
                    <p>The authors observe that this complete randomization of phase is unnecessary for many
                        generative tasks. Instead, they propose preserving the phase information from the input
                        image while applying noise only to the magnitude spectrum. This can be expressed formally:
                        for an image $x_0$ with Fourier decomposition $x_0 = M_0 e^{i\phi_0}$ where $M_0$ is
                        magnitude and $\phi_0$ is phase, the forward diffusion process becomes:</p>
                    <p>$$q_{\phi-PD}(x_t | x_0) = M_t e^{i\phi_0}$$</p>
                    <p>where $M_t$ follows the standard diffusion trajectory for magnitude components. By decoupling
                        magnitude and phase, the model preserves spatial structure throughout the diffusion process
                        while maintaining the flexibility to generate diverse content within that structure.</p>

                    <!-- METHODOLOGY -->
                    <section class="post-section">
                        <h2>Methodology: Phase-Preserving Diffusion Framework</h2>
                        <p>The core contribution of NeuralRemaster is the φ-PD framework, which reformulates the
                            diffusion process to preserve input phase while randomizing magnitude. The implementation is
                            remarkably straightforward, requiring only a modification to how noise is processed, not to
                            the underlying diffusion network architecture.</p>

                        <h3>The Phase-Preserving Reformulation</h3>
                        <p>Given an input image $x_0$, the forward diffusion process under φ-PD operates as follows.
                            First, both the input and noise are transformed into the frequency domain using the Fast
                            Fourier Transform (FFT). In frequency space, the input becomes $\tilde{x}_0 = M_0
                            e^{i\phi_0}$ and the noise becomes $\tilde{\epsilon} = M_\epsilon e^{i\phi_\epsilon}$. The
                            key innovation is that instead of combining these in the standard way (which would preserve
                            neither magnitude nor phase), the authors construct the noisy image as:</p>
                        <p>$$\tilde{x}_t = \left(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} M_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha}_t} M_\epsilon\right)
                            e^{i\phi_0}$$</p>
                        <p>This operation preserves the original phase $\phi_0$ throughout the diffusion process while
                            allowing the magnitude to follow the standard diffusion trajectory. The noisy image is then
                            transformed back to the spatial domain using the inverse FFT to produce $x_t$. This process
                            requires only a few additional FFT operations at each diffusion step, adding negligible
                            computational overhead (typically less than 2-3% in practice).</p>

                        <h3>Frequency-Selective Structured Noise</h3>
                        <p>To provide practitioners with fine-grained control over the degree of spatial rigidity, the
                            authors introduce Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise. Rather than preserving phase
                            uniformly across all frequency components, FSS noise introduces a frequency cutoff parameter
                            $f_c$ that controls which frequencies preserve their phase information. Frequencies below
                            the cutoff preserve phase (maintaining fine spatial structure), while frequencies above the
                            cutoff allow phase randomization (enabling higher-level content variation).</p>
                        <p>Formally, FSS noise modifies the phase preservation mechanism as:</p>
                        <p>$$\phi_t(f) = \begin{cases} \phi_0(f) & \text{if } f \lt f_c \\ \phi_\epsilon(f) & \text{if }
                            f \geq f_c \end{cases}$$</p>
                        <p>This frequency-selective approach enables a continuous spectrum of control from rigid
                            structure preservation (high $f_c$) to flexible content generation (low $f_c$). By varying
                            this single parameter, users can balance between maintaining geometric consistency and
                            allowing semantic variation—a capability that proves invaluable across different
                            applications.</p>

                        <h3>Compatibility with Existing Diffusion Models</h3>
                        <p>A critical strength of φ-PD is its universal applicability. Because phase preservation is
                            implemented purely as a modification to the data preprocessing pipeline, it requires no
                            changes to diffusion model architectures, training procedures, or inference code. This means
                            φ-PD can be applied to any existing diffusion model—whether it was trained on general image
                            synthesis, text-to-image generation, or domain-specific tasks. The framework is equally
                            compatible with video diffusion models, requiring only extensions of the FFT operations to
                            the temporal dimension.</p>

                        <h2>Applications: Where Structure Alignment Matters</h2>

                        <h3>Photorealistic Re-rendering</h3>
                        <p>One of the most compelling applications of φ-PD is photorealistic re-rendering, where the
                            goal is to generate novel views of scenes while maintaining spatial consistency with the
                            original geometry. Traditional diffusion models struggle with this task because they cannot
                            distinguish between variations that preserve geometry (acceptable) and variations that
                            distort it (unacceptable). By preserving phase information, φ-PD ensures that the spatial
                            structure of the scene—encoded in the input image—remains stable across generated outputs.
                            This enables high-quality re-renders where objects maintain their positions, camera
                            intrinsics are respected, and geometric relationships are preserved, while allowing
                            variations in lighting, material properties, and other view-dependent effects.</p>

                        <h3>Simulation-to-Reality Enhancement</h h3>
                            <p>A particularly important application domain is sim-to-real transfer for robotics.
                                Simulated environments, while useful for training embodied agents, typically exhibit
                                visual artifacts and stylistic differences from real-world data that can cause trained
                                planners to fail when deployed on real robots. Rather than retraining on expensive
                                real-world data or using domain adaptation techniques that may corrupt geometric
                                information, φ-PD enables direct enhancement of simulated images toward real-world
                                appearance while preserving the spatial structure that planners rely on. The authors
                                demonstrate this by applying φ-PD to enhance CARLA simulator outputs toward Waymo
                                real-world data distribution, achieving a 50% improvement in downstream planner
                                performance on real data—a remarkable result that demonstrates the utility of structure
                                preservation in safety-critical applications.</p>

                            <h3>Image-to-Image Translation</h3>
                            <p>Image-to-image translation tasks, such as style transfer, weather conversion (sunny to
                                rainy), or time-of-day adaptation, require changing visual appearance while maintaining
                                scene geometry. φ-PD provides a natural framework for such tasks by preserving the phase
                                (geometry) while allowing magnitude (appearance) to be transformed according to the
                                diffusion process. This is particularly valuable for applications requiring consistent
                                registration across translated image pairs, such as medical imaging augmentation or
                                architectural visualization.</p>

                            <h3>Quantitative Benchmarks</h3>
                            <p>The authors conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple domains to validate φ-PD's
                                effectiveness. For photorealistic re-rendering tasks, they measure geometric consistency
                                using optical flow metrics and evaluate perceptual quality using LPIPS scores. Their
                                results
                                demonstrate that φ-PD achieves superior geometric alignment compared to baseline
                                diffusion
                                models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality.</p>

                            <h3>Sim-to-Real Transfer Learning</h3>
                            <p>The most impressive experimental result involves sim-to-real transfer in the autonomous
                                driving domain. The authors train a motion planner on CARLA simulator data, then test
                                its
                                performance on Waymo real-world data. Without any enhancement, the planner achieves 48%
                                success rate on real data, reflecting the domain gap between simulation and reality.
                                When
                                applied to enhance simulated images using φ-PD before feeding them to the planner's
                                downstream processing pipeline, the success rate jumps to 72%—a 50% relative
                                improvement.
                                This result is particularly significant because it demonstrates that geometry
                                preservation
                                is not merely an academic concern but has direct practical implications for
                                safety-critical
                                applications like autonomous driving.</p>

                            <p>Beyond quantitative metrics, the authors provide extensive qualitative comparisons.
                                Visual
                                inspection reveals that φ-PD generates outputs with markedly better geometric
                                consistency
                                compared to baseline diffusion models. In re-rendering tasks, object positions remain
                                stable, camera distortions are minimized, and spatial relationships are preserved. In
                                style
                                transfer applications, the structural integrity of scenes is maintained while achieving
                                meaningful appearance variations. These qualitative results align with and reinforce the
                                quantitative findings, providing confidence in the method's practical utility.</p>
                            <h2>Frequency-Selective Structured Noise: Balancing Structure and Variation</h2>
                            <p>While full phase preservation yields impressive geometric alignment, practitioners often
                                need
                                to balance structural rigidity against the ability to introduce meaningful variations.
                                This
                                is where Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise becomes valuable. By introducing a
                                frequency cutoff parameter, the method enables a spectrum of control options.</p>
                            <p>Low frequency cutoffs preserve only the coarse spatial structure (e.g., general scene
                                layout)
                                while allowing mid and high-frequency variations, enabling more aggressive style changes
                                while maintaining overall geometry. High frequency cutoffs preserve fine spatial
                                details,
                                including textures and small-scale features, ensuring maximum geometric consistency but
                                potentially limiting appearance variation. The authors demonstrate this spectrum
                                empirically, showing that practitioners can tune the cutoff parameter to achieve
                                task-specific trade-offs between structure preservation and content diversity.</p>
                            <p>This frequency-selective approach is particularly valuable for applications like
                                architectural visualization, where maintaining the building's geometry is critical but
                                varying lighting and environmental conditions should be possible, or medical imaging,
                                where
                                anatomical structure must be preserved while enhancing or modifying appearance for
                                diagnostic purposes.</p>
                            <h2>Computational Efficiency and Scalability</h2>
                            <p>A key strength of φ-PD is its computational efficiency. The framework adds minimal
                                computational overhead to the diffusion process. FFT operations on modern hardware
                                (particularly GPUs with optimized FFT libraries) add only 2-3% to total inference time.
                                More
                                importantly, φ-PD requires no architectural modifications, no additional trainable
                                parameters, and no changes to training procedures. This means it can be applied to any
                                existing pre-trained diffusion model as a post-hoc enhancement with zero additional
                                training
                                cost.</p>
                            <p>The memory overhead is similarly negligible—only the intermediate Fourier representations
                                need to be stored, which have the same memory footprint as the spatial representations
                                they
                                replace. This makes φ-PD particularly attractive for resource-constrained settings where
                                computational efficiency is paramount.</p>
                            <h2>Theoretical Insights: Why Phase Preservation Works</h2>
                            <p>The success of phase preservation can be understood through signal processing theory. In
                                classical image analysis, it has been established that phase information carries
                                substantially more perceptually relevant information about spatial structure than
                                magnitude
                                information. The phase spectrum encodes edge positions, object boundaries, and geometric
                                relationships, while magnitude primarily captures texture and appearance properties. By
                                preserving phase throughout the diffusion process, φ-PD ensures that this structural
                                information remains intact.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, from a diffusion perspective, phase preservation reduces the effective
                                complexity of the task the model must learn. By constraining the model to only modify
                                magnitude while leaving phase fixed, the model has fewer degrees of freedom but operates
                                within a more meaningful and interpretable latent space. This constraint can actually
                                improve model efficiency—the model learns to focus its representational capacity on
                                meaningful variations within a structure-preserving framework rather than attempting to
                                learn arbitrary transformations that may destroy geometric relationships.</p>
                            <h2>Limitations and Future Directions</h2>
                            <p>While φ-PD represents a significant advance for structure-aligned generation, it is not
                                without limitations. The approach is most effective for tasks where input phase is
                                meaningful and should be preserved. For highly abstract generation tasks where structure
                                should be more flexible, or for scenarios where the input phase information is corrupted
                                or
                                unreliable, unconstrained diffusion may actually be preferable.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, the method assumes that phase preservation in Fourier space directly
                                corresponds to spatial structure preservation in downstream tasks. While the empirical
                                results strongly support this assumption, edge cases may exist where Fourier phase is
                                not
                                the most appropriate representation of structural information for specific domains.</p>
                            <p>Future work could explore adaptive phase preservation strategies where different
                                frequency
                                components are preserved based on learned importance weights, or task-specific phase
                                preservation where the degree of preservation is determined by the downstream
                                application
                                requirements. Integration with other conditioning mechanisms and exploration of phase
                                preservation in alternative frequency domains (e.g., wavelet domains) could further
                                expand
                                the framework's applicability.</p>
                            <h2>Conclusion: A Simple Yet Powerful Innovation</h2>
                            <p>NeuralRemaster's Phase-Preserving Diffusion represents an elegant solution to a
                                fundamental
                                limitation of conventional diffusion models. By reformulating the diffusion process to
                                preserve input phase while randomizing magnitude, the method enables structure-aligned
                                generation without architectural changes, parameter overhead, or computational cost. The
                                framework is universally applicable to any diffusion model and addresses a critical need
                                across diverse domains—from photorealistic re-rendering to sim-to-real transfer in
                                robotics.

                                implications for safety-critical applications. The elegant frequency-selective
                                formulation
                                provides practitioners with intuitive control over the structure-variation trade-off,
                                enabling task-specific customization without model retraining.</p>
                            <p>As diffusion models continue to evolve and expand into new domains, insights like those

                                φ-PD—that small, mathematically principled modifications to the fundamental process can
                                unlock new capabilities—will remain crucial. This work exemplifies how deep
                                understanding of
                                signal processing principles applied to modern generative models can yield surprisingly
                                powerful and practical improvements. The NeuralRemaster framework, with its combination
                                of
                                simplicity, universality, and demonstrated effectiveness, deserves consideration as a
                                foundational technique for any application requiring spatially consistent generation.
